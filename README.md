## About the Project 
Write a program that reads a file of text fragments and attempts to reconstruct the original document
out of the fragments. The fragments were created by duplicating the original document many times
over and chopping each copy into pieces. The fragments overlap one another and your program will
search for overlaps and align the fragments to reassemble them into their original order.
